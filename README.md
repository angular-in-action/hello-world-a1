Stock tracking app written with Angular 1.4.x. This project is based on the 
[hello-world](https://github.com/angular-in-action/hello-world) project 
written for Angular2. For this application, we wanted to replicate the 
Angular2 version of the app in Angular 1. 

### Setup

Just run `npm start` to get everything setup and started. Then open up http://localhost:8081 and go!

Note: You can change the port in `server/config.json`
